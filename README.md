Background 
=========================================

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

Bike sharing system data is allowing us to conduct:

-Demand Prediction: Analyze historical bike usage patterns to predict future demand for bikes at different stations and time intervals. This can help in optimizing bike allocation, managing inventory, and improving user experience.

-Optimal Station Placement: Use data on bike usage and user behavior to identify the optimal locations for new bike stations. This can help in expanding the bike sharing network efficiently and meeting user demands.

-User Behavior Analysis: Analyze user patterns, such as popular routes, preferred stations, and trip durations. This information can be used to understand user preferences, plan infrastructure improvements, and customize services based on user needs.

-Operational Efficiency: Analyze bike maintenance and repair data to optimize the maintenance schedule and reduce downtime. This can help in improving bike availability and minimizing service disruptions.

-Pricing Strategies: Analyze data on user demographics, trip distances, and durations to develop effective pricing strategies. This can involve offering discounts, incentives, or subscription plans tailored to different user segments.

-Traffic Planning: Combine bike sharing data with other transportation data to analyze traffic patterns, identify congested areas, and optimize transportation systems. This can aid in urban planning and improving overall mobility.

-Sustainability Analysis: Assess the environmental impact of bike sharing systems by analyzing data on distances traveled, CO2 emissions saved, and mode shift from motorized vehicles to bikes. This can help measure the system's contribution to sustainability goals.

-User Satisfaction and Feedback: Use data on user ratings, feedback, and complaints to identify areas for improvement in the bike sharing system, such as station maintenance, bike quality, or app usability. This can help in enhancing user satisfaction and loyalty.

More current data is available on the website of Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
can be accessed here: http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. 
The data for 2019 and 2020 is containing different variables, these datasets cannot be just merged but have to be aligned before doing so.
